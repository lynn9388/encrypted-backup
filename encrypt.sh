# This script encrypts files and folders with AES-256. The password can be set
# in password.txt under the current directory. If password.txt doesn't exist or
# is empty, the script will ask for it first. It also creates encrypted.txt
# which contains the final filename and encrypted filename. The saving folder
# for encrypted files can be set with -d option and the default is Encrypted.
#
# Usage: ./encrypt.sh [-d path] file1 file2 file3 ...
